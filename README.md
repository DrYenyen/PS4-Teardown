On the PSU there is an antenna held down by 1 phillips screw after unscruwing it the antenna can be pulled back and released from the small L groove the cable sits in.
The PSU has 4 Phillips screws Phillips 00 and 0 can be used to unscrew them and an additional 2 Torx Securitiy screws (the one on the side of the fan is slightly longer) T8 and T9 security variant can be used to unscrew them.
Over the disc drive and fan similair screws to on the PSU are locatated over the shield although they vary in length and are mostly Phillips only 1 is Torx security and needs to be unscrewed (the rest should only be unscrewed if attempting to clean the Disc Drive or dust from the fan and heatsink).
Before trying to take the PSU out turn the console over and slide off the HDD bay cover located on the opposite side of the PSU mains socket.
