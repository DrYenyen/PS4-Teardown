Description and contents
To take it apart start by taking off the top panel this can be done by liting it away from the front where the usb ports are.
On the PSU there is an antenna held down by 1 phillips screw after unscruwing it the antenna can be pulled back and released from the small L groove the cable sits in.
The PSU has 4 Phillips screws Phillips 00 and 0 can be used to unscrew them and an additional 2 Torx Securitiy screws (the one on the side of the fan is slightly longer) T8 and T9 security variant can be used to unscrew them.
Over the disc drive and fan similair screws to on the PSU are locatated over the shield although they vary in length and are mostly Phillips only 1 is Torx security and needs to be unscrewed (the rest should only be unscrewed if attempting to clean the Disc Drive or dust from the fan and heatsink).
Before trying to take the PSU out turn the console over and slide off the HDD bay cover located on the opposite side of the PSU mains socket.
The HDD is held in by 1 Phillips screw after undoing it you can slide it out. 
Right next to the HDD bay cover is a warranty sticker take it off and under it is a Torx Security screw unscrew it and then pull away the bottom part of the housing starting from the back where you already are this needs more pressure than the top.
You can then prep for taking out the PSU.
1. Power button connected to the top of the main board by going over the disc drive taped down to disc drive take it off before removing the White antenna below has 1 Phillips screw its flex can be disconnected by pulling it towards the directtion its comming from by the blue tab  (take it off before removing the White antenna below)	
2. White antenna on the bottom side going over disc drive and part of the motherboard and to the WiFi/Blutooth IC has 1 Phillips screw and 2 pieces of tape near and thin cavities needs to be carefully disconnected from the motherboard.
2. Disc Drive Flex cables
*1st connected flex should be disconnected before taking off the Motherboard backplate this can be done by pulling it gently by the blue tab in the direction it is coming from.

*2nd connected flex  should be disconnected before taking off the Motherboard backplate this can be done by gently lifting up the black latch from the direction the flex cable is coming from then it can be pulled out from the direction it is coming from.

*3rd connected flex should be disconnected before taking off the Motherboard backplate this can be done by pulling it gently by the blue tab in the direction it is coming from.

Motherboard backplate 
This backplate has 3 kinds of screws 
1. Phillips long silver they always screw into plastic located on the edges all around some are screwed into the housing others into the PSU (all on the opposite side of the PSU should be unscrewed and the psu can be taken out if you only need the PSU)
2. Phillips short silver they always screw into short metal groves 2 are located to the righ and left of the Phillips screw slot for the HDD bay, 2 are located under the 3rd Disc Drive Flex, last 2 are located directly over the HDMI port.
3. Phillips black long  they are around the plate and always screw into metal groves.
The PSU can be pulled up and out it is reccomended to fold it onto the flat plat as a 4 wire PSU controller cable is connected it should be pulled out gently it is often quite hard so patience is needed wiggling slightly helps 
Be gentle when unrouting the black antenna cable and 4 wire PSU cable.	
Antenna under the PSU both can be gently disconnected from the motherboard the gray one can be removed from its C grove and set aside 
Be gentle when unrouting the black antenna cable and 4 wire PSU cable althoug if any of the L shaped holders break it is not a big issue.
the black one can be unrouted and removed from the housing it is held in with pressure but can be easily pulled up and away. The 4 wire cable can be unrouted from the housing and prepped to be pulled out from the other side. 
Going back to the motherboard
Disconnect the fan connector it is located between the 2 usb ports.
The motherboard heatsink clamp is held down by 2 phillips screws they are sometimes 1 colour or 2 colours but placement does not matter they can be unscrewed the clamp taken away and its small flat pressure disributor the motherboard can then be gently lifted away and pulled outward towards while taking care of the 4 wire PSU controller cable.
Once the motherboard is out it can be cleaned with a toothbrush or paintbrush some qtips and isopropyl alcohol. 
The APU can be cleaned of thermal paste with qtips gently to not damage components on it.
Taking off the heatsking can be done by unsrewing 2 screws down from the disc drive and 4 around the thermal transfer block.
The can is held down by 2 phillips screws.
